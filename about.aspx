  <h2 class="subheading">Our Story</h2>
  <p>Bran's Bakery was opened in 1942 by Bran Croiset. Bran grew up in rural
    France during World War 2. From a young age, Bran was obsessed with baking.
    He would often rush home everyday after school to bake and perfect his
    recipies. He wrote them all down in a book and we still use his book to this
    day. <br>
    When he was old enough, Bran then moved to Ireland to get away from the
    war and to fufill his lifelong dream of opening a bakery. Bran believed in
    the idea that baking does not need to be excessive and expensive. He believed
    that products that are made with passion and care can rise out on top.</p>

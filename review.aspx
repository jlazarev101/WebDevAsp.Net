    <p>"It’s hard to put into words how delicious the bread they make is.
      Unquestionably the best bread I’ve ever had. What’s their secret?
      Who knows! But I’m just glad to have them in the neighborhood.
      Seeded sourdough is my favourite, and try the croissant if you’re
      feeling like a treat."</p>

    <p>"Croissants have been ruined for me forever. I will never again eat a
      baked good that compares to the Bran's Bakery creations. Without sounding
      melodramatic, they are not baker's but artists. If you want the goods, be
      prepared to queue in the rain for fifteen or so minutes and make sure
      you're no later than an hour after they open. I am not a morning person,
      yet I somehow find myself in that queue in the rain at 8am more often than
      I care to admit."</p>

    <p>"Authentic bakery, if you are looking for artisan tasty bread and
      pastries, a great spot to support in these hard times"</p>

    <p>"Best croissants and baguettes in Ireland. Taste like French bakeries.
      I am impressed. My favorite bakery now!!!"</p>
    <p class="from">-Stephen</p><br>
    <p>"I don't buy croissants anywhere else now because nowhere else really
      compares. If I came across Bran's Bakery on holiday I'd be telling people
      about it when I got home."</p>

    <p>"Its incredible to have such an amazing bakery in Dun Laoghaire and run
      by such lovely people."</p>
